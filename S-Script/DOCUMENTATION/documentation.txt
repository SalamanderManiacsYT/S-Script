No multi line stacking (i.e. 'p "hi" || prints hi') with s-script, sorry

[brackets] are optional choices, <LT GT> are required. for info on <eval>/[eval] see eval docs

s-script will run until it hits an error, unless you have ignore errors on (see consoleCmdDocs)



p <eval(any)>

| Prints to the console. What did you think it did?



f name  
    code
    code
    code
endf

runf [filename(if not local!!)].<function>

| Function syntaxes. Arguments eventually will come out.



|| [literally anything]

| Comment, must have space between comment declaration and whatever after. I will eventually add |* and *|



runFile <filepath(s-script)>

| Runs another s-script file and enables its functions, being you use the correct syntax, filename.functionname. Filepath is relative to the main file being run but may change.



createV <name> <eval(any)>

setV <name> <eval(any)>

addToArray <name(array)> <eval(any)>

| Create a variable, weakly typed (it can change from int -> string -> bool -> array). setV sets a variable.



if <eval(bool)>

elseif <eval(bool)>

else 

endif

| If statement syntaxes.



write <filepath(any)> <eval(array)>

| Write to a file (Clears the file! To add a new line read the file THEN use addToArray THEN write).



w <eval(bool)>

endw

| While loop syntaxes (i hate causing myself pain)



delay ms

| Delay, use in while loops so it doesnt terminate
