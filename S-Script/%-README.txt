Hi! Meet s-script (Salamander Script)! A simple custom coding language compiled with Java! Java reads the s-script files and runs code based on the file.

You must have a MAINDIR/configs/ directory, or nothing will work!!!!


I reccomend reading all documentation, expecially consoleCmdDocs.txt. S-Script is unique in many ways, so reading docs is pretty important.

PREREQUISITES
have java

HOW TO RUN
Open command prompt or whatever teminal your device has
Copy the file path to the s-script shell
Type "java -jar " then paste the path
It should run

Happy coding!
